# FizzBuzz

The fizzbuzz function takes two arguments, the first and last numbers
for which you'd like to determine fizzbuzzery.

Plug your own numbers into the final line of fizzbuzz.rb, for example:

`fizzbuzz(33, 77)`

Run your updated file from the command line:

`ruby fizzbuzz.rb`

One line will print to the console for each number in the range given, declaring whether that number is Fizzy, Buzzy, FizzBuzzful or just an ordinary number.

**Note:** *the second number given as an argument to `fizzbuzz()` must be larger than the first, as this implementation uses a range object which evaluates to `nil` if that pattern is not followed.*
